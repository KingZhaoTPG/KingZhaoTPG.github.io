<h1>Good day fellow readers and welcome to my tech blog !</h1>

<p>
My name Shengbin Zhao.
I am currently an engineer engaged in database(postgres) kernel development.
At present, I mainly focus on the development of Postgres database kernel compatible with Oracle features,
Performance tuning, migration tool development, extensions, etc. It is also a member of the open source
database IvoryDB.

<p>
The purpose of my life?
Be yourself ! Be yourself ! Be yourself ! I firmly believe that the process is greater than the result,
and good things will eventually come ...
